Read data

```{r}
student_ratio <- readr::read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/master/data/2019/2019-05-07/student_teacher_ratio.csv")

```

Clean data

```{r}

med_ratios <- student_ratio %>% 
  filter(!is.na(student_ratio)) %>%      # remove NAs
  group_by(country_code, indicator) %>%
  filter(year == max(year)) %>%          # grab the most recent data for each country and education level
  ungroup() %>%
  group_by(country_code, country) %>%
  summarise(median_ratio = median(student_ratio)) 

```

Check names in med_ratios compared to map_data("world")
```{r}
anti_join(med_ratios, map_data("world"), by = c("country" = "region")) %>% View()
```


Need to recode some country names to match map_data 
```{r}
med_ratios_fixed <- med_ratios %>%
  mutate(country = recode(country,
                                "United States of America" = "USA",
                                "Viet Nam" = "Vietnam",
                                "British Virgin Islands" = "Virgin Islands",
                                "United Republic of Tanzania" = "Tanzania",
                                "Syrian Arab Republic" = "Syria",
                                "Russian Federation" = "Russia",
                                "Democratic People's Republic of Korea" = "North Korea",
                                "The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia" = "Macedonia",
                                "Republic of Moldova" = "Moldova",
                                "Republic of Korea" = "South Korea",
                                "CÃ´te d'Ivoire" = "Ivory Coast",
                                "Iran (Islamic Republic of)" = "Iran",
                                "United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland" = "UK",
                                "Micronesia (Federated States of)" = "Micronesia",
                                "Czechia" = "Czech Republic",
                                "Cabo Verde" = "Cape Verde",
                                "Congo" = "Democratic Republic of the Congo",
                                "Brunei Darussalam" = "Brunei",
                                "Bolivia (Plurinational State of)" = "Bolivia"))
                                
```

Join median student teacher ratio data with map data

```{r}
my_map_data <- med_ratios_fixed %>%
  full_join(map_data("world"), by = c("country" = "region")) %>% 
  filter(!grepl("Antarctica",country)) #don't need Antarctica
```


Plot
```{r}
ggplot(my_map_data, aes(x = long, y = lat)) +
     geom_polygon(aes(fill = median_ratio, group = group), color = "black", size = 0.2) +
     scale_fill_gradient2(low = "dark blue", high = "red", midpoint = 17.428480) +
     #dark_theme_gray() +
     theme_fivethirtyeight() + 
     theme(axis.line=element_blank(),
           axis.text.x=element_blank(),
           axis.text.y=element_blank(),
          panel.grid.major=element_blank(),
          panel.grid.minor=element_blank()) +
          #plot.background=element_blank()
     labs(fill = "ratio",
          title = "Median Student to Teacher Ratio",
          caption = "Median student-to-teacher ratio is calculated for each country across all education levels (). Only the most recent data\nis used in the calculations. Countries shown in white have a median ratio close to the world median ratio. Countries\nshown in blue have a smaller ratio, while countries shown in red have a larger (less favorable) ratio. Countries shown in\ngrey are missing data.") 
  
```


#TODO:

* Why are some countries missing?
* Use average instead of median?
* Add education levels to caption.
* Add some fonts?
* ggrepel to highlight red country?
